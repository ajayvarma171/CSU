**Analyzing Market Trends and Consumer Behavior for a New Product Launch**
**Project Description**
The project will undertake two core research areas based on trending market patterns, customer groups, product choices, and first adopters of new products. The project aimed to discover trends from analytics, including segmentation, behavior analysis, and predictive scenarios, to identify new products that meet the market dynamics. Through predictive modeling, machine learning algorithms are used to build models of consumer responses to new product introductions. Besides, predictive modeling also allows forecasting consumer behavior and factors influencing consumer choice.
**Dataset Selection**
We have selected the "supermarket sales" dataset available on Kaggle for analysis. This dataset contains transactional records from supermarket sales, capturing essential details such as customer demographics, product information, and purchase specifics.
**Features and what I am predicting**
The "supermarket sales" dataset contains information on customer transactions in three supermarket branches in three cities, along with well-known cities such as Yangon, Naypyitaw, and Mandalay. The data set gives details of the invoice ID, date, time, branch, city, customer group, gender, product line, product price, amount, tax rate, total amount, payment method, raw material, gross margin percentage, gross income, and ranking. The function of the features is to illustrate all different parts of the order or a customer, including product, price, and the way of payment that they used, with the rating explaining the satisfaction level that they had.Project plans to investigate market trends and buyer behavior for a brand’s new product release. 
The research questions of this project are targeted towards consumer behavior and market patterns; their mission is to help the strategy build a better performance in the market. More concretely, the project aims to answer market trends in the business area, consumers’ age-marital status, and how current and new products are accepted among clients and adopted by them. The aim is to get the activity done resulting from EDA (exploratory data analysis), customer segmentation, behavior analysis, and predictive modeling by introducing that these factors influence consumer behavior choice and later affect new products’ performance.
Predicting consumer behavior factors was done by applying predictive analytics techniques like decision trees, logistic regression, and clustering. These approaches aim to create a model to anticipate consumers' reactions to new product launches due to their pricing, features, and promotions. Customer models will be made based on customers' age, location, and the way they buy. The venture will explore the correlation of various factors, such as pattern recognition tools used to remove or correct the data set anomalies, which will increase the model's precision. Research Questions

**Market Insights:**
 What are the prevailing market trends influencing consumer behavior?
How do customer demographics correlate with product preferences and purchasing
patterns?
**Product Launch Strategy:**
 What factors influence consumer acceptance and adoption of new products?
How can we align product attributes with consumer preferences to optimize market
penetration?
**Project outline:**
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
• Visualize sales trends, customer demographics, and product preferences using histograms, bar
charts, and pie charts.
• Analyze relationships between variables using correlation matrices and heatmap
visualizations.
• Clean the dataset by addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Consumer Segmentation
• Apply clustering techniques (e.g., K-means clustering) to group customers based on
demographics and purchasing patterns.
• Characterize consumer segments to tailor marketing strategies effectively. Consumer Behavior Analysis
• Investigate the impact of pricing, product features, and promotions on consumer behavior.
• Develop predictive models to forecast consumer responses to new product launches. Predictive Modeling
The predictive models built in this stage seek to analyze the impact of pricing, product features, and promotions on consumer behavior and predict the factors influencing consumer acceptance and adoption of new products.
• Utilize machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression) to build predictive
models.
• Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics (e.g., F1-score, AUC) and cross-
validation techniques to ensure reliability.
Our project aims to leverage data analytics to gain actionable insights into market
trends and consumer behavior, providing strategic guidance for a successful new product launch. By systematically conducting exploratory data analysis, consumer segmentation, behavior analysis, and predictive modeling, we aim to optimize# CSU
